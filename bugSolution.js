The solution to this type of error often involves a systematic approach. First, ensure all your packages are up-to-date using `expo upgrade`. Next, carefully review your `package.json` and `metro.config.js` files for any inconsistencies or misconfigurations. Pay close attention to dependencies, especially native modules, and ensure their compatibility with your Expo SDK version. If the problem persists, try creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problematic code.  If the issue involves a specific native module, consider checking its documentation for known issues or compatibility requirements. In some cases, reinstalling node modules (`npm install` or `yarn install`) can also resolve dependency-related problems.  If all else fails, cleaning the cache (`expo start --clear`) might be necessary.
