This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and involves issues with the Metro bundler, particularly when dealing with complex projects or custom configurations.  It might manifest as a cryptic error message, a hanging process, or a failure to start the development server. The root cause is often difficult to pinpoint, but may stem from incorrect package versions, conflicting dependencies, or problems with native modules.
